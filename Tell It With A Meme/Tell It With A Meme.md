***Tell It With a Meme: Architectural Trade-offs***<br>

Each application architecture has a set of trade-offs that needs to be considered at the genesis of a project.<br>
But it is also important to understand how the application will be
maintained in the future e.g. at scale, under load, supporting multiple
releases a day, etc.<br>
The categories that are used to evaluate trade-offs are:<br>
- <b>Development complexity:</b> The effort required to deploy and manage the application
- <b>Scalability:</b> The ability of an application to respond to incoming traffic appropriately
- <b>Time to deploy:</b> The building of an application through a delivery pipeline to ship features
- <b>Flexibility:</b> The ability of an application to adapt to new technologies or introduce new features
- <b>Operational cost:</b> The cost of resources to release the application
- <b>Reliability:</b> The ability of an application to recover from failure and its provisions for monitoring and observability
