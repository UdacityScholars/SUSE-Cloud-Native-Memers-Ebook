To all #st_memers colleagues,

Some good practices for study is to create summaries and resources for yourself, you may come back to them when ever you need :books:

- By quoting the important **phrases** and **cmds** in a minimal but efficient way.
- Shortening points and steps. Using lists in general is very nice.
- Remember don’t waste time formatting the files to look beautiful, but understandable.

Organize files and folders is very important to help easy access of info and it reflects and improves how was info been organized in your mind. Below is my way to organize my files:
```
SUSE folder
       |__ lessons folder
          |__ 1. Intro
          |__ 2. Architecture Considerations
          |__ . . . 
       |__ files folder
          |__ files by colleagues pptx, pdf
          |__ . . .
       |__ projects folder
          |__ examples cloned from github
          |__ created by me
          |__ . . . 
```
This is my way and I thought it’s helpful to share it with you. You may modify it to the best that suites you.

Wish you all the best  :wave:
